1) Could be a little bit more excact

2) You can add the info of a metadata file.

3) And how do you do that exactly?

4) There is a formula for that. What means "has to be taken care of" exactly?

5) By the system? Which one exactly. I guess you mean the metadata file but if not you should provide that information.

6) Well yeah i guess it makes sense but you could specify the marking as free part a little bit more? Also how do you exactly "remove something" from a directory?
